## SOLUTION
SELECT DISTINCT p.product_id,
       CASE WHEN last_date IS NOT NULL THEN p.new_price ELSE 10 END AS price
FROM Products p
LEFT JOIN (
           SELECT DISTINCT product_id, MAX(change_date) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id) AS last_date
           FROM Products
           WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
           ) last
ON p.product_id = last.product_id
WHERE last_date IS NULL OR last_date = change_date






Table: Products

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
 

Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

The query result format is in the following example:

Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+
