## SOLUTION
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS int
BEGIN 
RETURN (SELECT DISTINCT salary as 'getNthHighestSalary(N)'
        FROM (SELECT salary,
                     rank()over(order by salary DESC) as rnk
               FROM employee) a
         WHERE rnk = n);
 END






Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
