## QUESTION:
The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.
+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+

In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.
+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |
+--------+
Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.


## SOLUTION:
SOLUTION1:
SELECT AVG(Number) median
FROM
(
  (
   SELECT Number 
   From
   (SELECT Number, SUM(Frequency)OVER(ORDER by Number ACS) presum
    FROM Numbers) t1
    WHERE presum >= CEILING((SELECT SUM(Frequency) FROM Numbers)/2)
    ORDER BY Number
    LIMIT 1
   )
   UNION ALL
   (
   SELECT Number
   FROM 
   (SELECT Numbers, SUM(Frequency)OVER(ORDER BY Number DESC) aftersum
    FROM Numbers) t2
    WHERE aftersum >= CEILING((SELECT SUM(Frequency) FROM Numbers)/2)
    ORDER BY Number DESC
    LIMIT 1
   )
) temp


SOLUTION2:
SELECT AVG(Number) Median
FROM
(
  SELECT Number, SUM(Frequency)OVER(ORDER BY Number ACS) c1,
                 SUM(Frequency)OVER(ORDER BY Number DESC) c2,
                 SUM(Frequency)OVER() cnt
  FROM Numbers
) t
WHERE c1> = cnt/2 and c2 >= cnt/2
