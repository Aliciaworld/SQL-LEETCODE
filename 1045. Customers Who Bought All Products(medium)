## SOLUTION 1
SELECT Cutomer_id
FROM (SELECT customer_id, product_key
      FROM Customer
      GROUPY BY customer_id) a
WHERE a.product_key = (SELECT DISTINCT product_key From Product)


## SOLUTION 2
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
Group by customer_id
HAVING count(distinct product_key) =
       (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) FROM Product)
** The foreign key prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreigh key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.**

Write an SQL query for a report that provides the customer ids from the Customer table that bought all the products in the Product table.

For example:

Customer table:
+-------------+-------------+
| customer_id | product_key |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+

Product table:
+-------------+
| product_key |
+-------------+
| 5           |
| 6           |
+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
The customers who bought all the products (5 and 6) are customers with id 1 and 3.
