Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Note: All emails are in lowercase.

## solution
solution 1:
并不是好的解决方法，如果两个重复的值的id相同，或者有3个重复值会导致输出不止1个
	SELECT DISTINCT P1.Email 
	FROM Person P1, Person P2
	WHERE P1.id != P2.id and P1.email=P2.email

solution 2:（good one)
	SELECT Email 
	FROM Person
	GROUP BY Email
	Having count(Email)>1
	
solution 3:
	SELECT Email 
	FROM (
			SELECT Email, COUNT(Email) as num from Person
			group by Email
		) AS statistic
	WHERE num > 1
