Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+

Note：Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.

###solution
solution 1:
key:直接使用delete语句
	DELETE P1 FROM Person P1, Person P2
	WHERE P1.Email = P2.Email AND P1.Id > P2.Id

solution 2:
	DELETE FROM Person
	WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT t.id FROM (SELECT MIN(id) as id FROM Person GROUP BY email) t)
	
以下语句错误的原因的是不能先select了一些值，然后又去修改（比如，这里的删除）这个表
	DELETE FROM Person
	WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(id) as id FROM Person GROUP BY email) 

？？？
为什么不能使用SELECT MIN(id) as id FROM Person GROUP BY email
